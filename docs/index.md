# GitLab Runner

[![Build Status](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner)

GitLab Runner is the open source project that is used to run your jobs and
send the results back to GitLab. It is used in conjunction with [GitLab CI][ci],
the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab that
coordinates the jobs.

## Requirements

GitLab Runner is written in [Go][golang] and can be run as a single binary, no
language specific requirements are needed.

It is designed to run on the GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
Other operating systems will probably work as long as you can compile a Go
binary on them.

If you want to use Docker make sure that you have version `v1.5.0` at least
installed.

## Features

- Allows to run:
 - multiple jobs concurrently
 - use multiple tokens with multiple server (even per-project)
 - limit number of concurrent jobs per-token
- Jobs can be run:
 - locally
 - using Docker containers
 - using Docker containers and executing job over SSH
 - using Docker containers with autoscaling on different clouds and virtualization hypervisors
 - connecting to remote SSH server
- Is written in Go and distributed as single binary without any other requirements
- Supports Bash, Windows Batch and Windows PowerShell
- Works on GNU/Linux, OS X and Windows (pretty much anywhere you can run Docker)
- Allows to customize the job running environment
- Automatic configuration reload without restart
- Easy to use setup with support for Docker, Docker-SSH, Parallels or SSH running environments
- Enables caching of Docker containers
- Easy installation as a service for GNU/Linux, OSX and Windows
- Embedded Prometheus metrics HTTP server

## Compatibility chart

CAUTION: **Important:**
GitLab Runner >= 9.0 requires GitLab's API v4 endpoints, which were introduced
in GitLab CE/EE 9.0. Because of this change, GitLab Runner >= 9.0 requires
GitLab CE/EE >= 9.0 and will not work with older GitLab versions.
The old API used by GitLab Runner was deprecated in August 2017 and with this,
the v1.11.x version of GitLab Runner is deprecated as well.

In the following table you can see the compatibility chart between GitLab and
GitLab Runner.
